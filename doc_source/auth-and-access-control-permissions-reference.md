# CodeCommit Permissions Reference<a name="auth-and-access-control-permissions-reference"></a>

The following tables list each CodeCommit API operation, the corresponding actions for which you can grant permissions, and the format of the resource ARN to use for granting permissions\. The CodeCommit APIs are grouped into tables based on the scope of the actions allowed by that API\. Refer to it when setting up [Access Control](auth-and-access-control.md#access-control) and writing permissions policies that you can attach to an IAM identity \(identity\-based policies\)\. 

When you create a permissions policy, you specify the actions in the policy's `Action` field\. You specify the resource value in the policy's `Resource` field as an ARN, with or without a wildcard character \(\*\)\. 

To express conditions in your CodeCommit policies, use AWS\-wide condition keys\. For a complete list of AWS\-wide keys, see [Available Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

**Note**  
To specify an action, use the `codecommit:` prefix followed by the API operation name \(for example, `codecommit:GetRepository` or `codecommit:CreateRepository`\. 

**Using Wildcards **

To specify multiple actions or resources, use a wildcard character \(\*\) in your ARN\. For example, `codecommit:*` specifies all CodeCommit actions and `codecommit:Get*` specifies all CodeCommit actions that begin with the word `Get`\. The following example grants access to all repositories with names that begin with `MyDemo`\. 

```
arn:aws:codecommit:us-west-2:111111111111:MyDemo*
```

You can use wildcards only with the *repository\-name* resources listed in the following table\. You can't use wildcards with *region* or *account\-id* resources\. For more information about wildcards, see [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html) in *IAM User Guide*\.

## Required Permissions for Git Client Commands<a name="aa-git"></a>

In CodeCommit, the `GitPull` IAM policy permissions apply to any Git client command where data is retrieved from CodeCommit, including git fetch, git clone, and so on\. Similarly, the `GitPush` IAM policy permissions apply to any Git client command where data is sent to CodeCommit\. For example, if the `GitPush` IAM policy permission is set to `Allow`, a user can push the deletion of a branch using the Git protocol\. That push is unaffected by any permissions applied to the `DeleteBranch` operation for that IAM user\. The `DeleteBranch` permission applies to actions performed with the console, the AWS CLI, the SDKs, and the API, but not the Git protocol\. 

`GitPull` and `GitPush` are IAM policy permissions\. They are not API actions\.

**CodeCommit Required Permissions for Actions for Git Client Commands**  

| CodeCommit Permissions for Git | Required Permissions  | Resources | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  GitPull  |  `codecommit:GitPull` Required to pull information from a CodeCommit repository to a local repo\. This is an IAM policy permission only, not an API action\.  |  arn:aws:codecommit:*region*:*account\-id*:*repository\-name*  | 
|  GitPush  |  `codecommit:GitPush` Required to push information from a local repo to a CodeCommit repository\. This is an IAM policy permission only, not an API action\.  If you create a policy that includes a context key and a `Deny` statement that includes this permission, you must also include a `Null` context\. For more information, see [Limit Pushes and Merges to Branches in AWS CodeCommit](how-to-conditional-branch.md)\.   |  arn:aws:codecommit:*region*:*account\-id*:*repository\-name*  | 

## Permissions for Actions on Branches<a name="aa-branches"></a>

The following permissions allow or deny actions on branches in CodeCommit repositories\. These permissions pertain only to actions performed in the CodeCommit console and with the CodeCommit API, and to commands performed using the AWS CLI\. They do not pertain to similar actions that can be performed using the Git protocol\. For example, the **git show\-branch \-r** command displays a list of remote branches for a repository and its commits using the Git protocol\. It's not affected by any permissions for the CodeCommit `ListBranches` operation\.

Comments cannot be deleted, but the content of a comment can be removed if the user has this permission\.   |  arn:aws:codecommit:*region*:*account\-id*:*repository\-name*  | 
|  [GetComment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/APIReference/API_GetComment.html)  |  `codecommit:GetComment` Required to return information about a comment made on a change, file, or commit in a CodeCommit repository\.  |  arn:aws:codecommit:*region*:*account\-id*:*repository\-name*  |

## Permissions for Actions on Committed Code<a name="aa-code"></a>

The following permissions allow or deny actions on code committed to CodeCommit repositories\. These permissions pertain to actions performed with the CodeCommit console and the CodeCommit API, and commands performed using the AWS CLI\. They do not pertain to similar actions that can be performed using the Git protocol\. For example, the **git commit** command creates a commit for a branch in a repository using the Git protocol\. It's not affected by any permissions for the CodeCommit `CreateCommit` operation\. 

Explicitly denying some of these permissions might result in unexpected consequences in the CodeCommit console\. For example, setting `GetTree` to `Deny` prevents users from navigating the contents of a repository in the console, but does not block users from viewing the contents of a file in the repository \(if they are sent a link to the file in email, for example\)\. Setting `GetBlob` to `Deny` prevents users from viewing the contents of files, but does not block users from browsing the structure of a repository\. Setting `GetCommit` to `Deny` prevents users from retrieving details about commits\. Setting `GetObjectIdentifier` to `Deny` blocks most of the functionality of code browsing\. If you set all three of these actions to `Deny` in a policy, a user with that policy cannot browse code in the CodeCommit console\.

If you see an expand arrow \(**↗**\) in the upper\-right corner of the table, you can open the table in a new window\. To close the window, choose the close button \(**X**\) in the lower\-right corner\.

## Permissions for Actions on CodePipeline Integration<a name="aa-acp"></a>

In order for CodePipeline to use a CodeCommit repository in a source action for a pipeline, you must grant all of the permissions listed in the following table to the service role for CodePipeline\. If these permissions are not set in the service role or are set to **Deny**, the pipeline does not run automatically when a change is made to the repository, and changes cannot be released manually\. 

If you see an expand arrow \(**↗**\) in the upper\-right corner of the table, you can open the table in a new window\. To close the window, choose the close button \(**X**\) in the lower\-right corner\.
